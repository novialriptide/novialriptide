## 👾 About Me 
A class of 2026 student pursing a major in Computer Science. I contributed to some open-source projects
such as [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commits?author=novialriptide) (the popular circle-clicking
rhythm game), [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/commits?author=novialriptide)
(the fork of the popular Python game framework), and a
[work-in-progress collisions library](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-geometry/commits?author=novialriptide)
written in C for pygame-ce. Currently I am the lead maintainer for the
[pygame-ce website](https://github.com/pygame-community/pyga.me/commits?author=novialriptide), a
[PythonDiscord](https://discord.gg/python) Partner, and designing a new website for
[HPy](https://github.com/novialriptide/hpyproject.org). I was also originally a contributor to the legacy
[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/commits?author=novialriptide) project as well. I am currently
developing a video game with its own game engine; you can read about it [here](https://reigngame.net/).
